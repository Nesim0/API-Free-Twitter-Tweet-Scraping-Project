# API-Free Twitter Tweet Scraping Project
Description
This project aims to collect tweets from Twitter without using APIs, employing browser automation and web scraping techniques. User login is performed, and all tweets associated with a specific hashtag are gathered. This approach allows users to fetch data independently, providing a completely API-free solution.
